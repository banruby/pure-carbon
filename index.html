						<h3>Crave</h3>
						<p>Four different bodies occupying one life. The fractured voices of the whole describe their desires, remember losses in the past, and question their future in the face of their trauma.  The play is known for the sheer force of its language and its penetrating gaze into the human psyche. Twenty years later it still has the power to arouse pity, fear, laughter, and catharsis.</p>

						<p>Crave was originally produced by The Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in August 1998 under a pseudonym, to avoid association with Kane’s violent, controversial earlier work, such as Blasted and Phaedra’s Love. Kane’s work was extremely controversial in its time, buts he has since become a revered voice in contemporary theatre, with productions of her work performed all over the globe.</p>

						<h3>Private Lives</h3>
						<p>NOEL COWARD + COLE PORTER + EYES WIDE SHUT</p>
						<p>Private Lives is a comedy of manners that shows off Noel Coward’s signature wit and charm. The story concerns a separated couple (Amanda & Elyot) who, while on vacation at a tropical resort with their new partners (Victor & Sybil, respectively), discover that they are staying in adjacent rooms at the same resort. In our interpretation we delve deeply into the sexual politics of the play, examining the crazy things we do for love and the necessary role that sex, and sexual compatibility play in our relationships. We watch as the characters dive headfirst into their volatile, kinky and fetish filled sex lives, and ask the question: Can some loves be too passionate, too intense, or too sexy to maintain?</p>

						<h3>Bitchcraft</h3>
						<p>Mean Girls + Arthur Miller + American Horror Story</p>
						<p>2015. Salem, Massachusetts. A group of high school girls meet for a sleepover. Hazel’s birthday party starts off innocently enough: underage drinking, a game of truth or dare, and some playful banter. But when a Ouija board is given as a gift, the spirit of Abigail Williams, the instigator of the Salem Witch Trials, is released. Girl is pitted against girl, witch against witch, and the coven is tested.</p>
						<p>Just in time for Halloween, the witches are back! Come experience the fun, the fear, the feels and the frenzy that is Bitchcraft. The show was originally devised as part of Pure Carbon’s Experiment Series, using Arthur Miller’s The Crucible as an inspiration. After the sold out workshop this spring, the coven returns with this revised production – more laughs, more screams and more party. You are invited to Hazel’s 18th birthday party –  black clothes, dark lipstick and and a taste for danger are all you need to attend.</p>

						<h3>La Loca / Red Winter</h3>
						<p>La Loca brings to life the story of Joanna the “Mad”, a sixteenth century queen of Spain, who was forcibly confined for the last fifty years of her life. On the day of her death, the phantoms in her mind lead her through her fractured memories, taking on the roles of her family and loved ones, to look back on her life and reign.</p>
						<p>Red Winter is sensual, brutal and visceral re-imagining of the Little Red Riding Hood fable told entirely through movement and music. Set in a savage world, Red is recast as the master of her own destiny pushing the story into uncharted territory.</p>

				<div class="experiment-description">
					<h4>What's an experiment?</h4>
					<p class="experiment-description">Experiments are short, radical reinterpretations of classic texts that are put on with minimal rehearsal, expense and no frills production values. It is an opportunity for us to collaborate with new artists, hone our skills, and gives us an opportunity to get our name out into the wider artistic community.</p>

						<h5>The House of Bernadette Alba</h5>
						<p>Summer 1971. A small town in Quebec at the height of Francophone/Anglophone tension in Canada. Bernadette Alba’s
						husband Anthony has just died, leaving her a widow and to care for her five young daughters alone. Plunging her family into a state of intense mourning, Bernadette rules her daughters with an iron fist, forcing them to follow a strict moral code of propriety and religious fervour. But teenage girls are a force to reckoned with, and as the summer progresses tensions in the Alba household simmer to a boiling point.</p>

						<h5>64 Ways to Die: A Shakespeare Death Cabaret</h5>
						<p>An encyclopedic variety show of every death from Shakespeare’s tragedies performed in every style imaginable. We’re talking everything from slam poetry, physical theatre, burlesque, drag, puppetry, clown, performance art, and traditional Elizabethan performance. Highlights include the final scene of Hamlet as a drinking game, Cleopatra performing a deathly strip tease, Romeo and Juliet taking selfies and hashtagging from the tomb, and an epic pie fight that ends everyone in Titus Andronicus.</p>

						<h5>Three Sisters</h5>
						<p>In this reimagining of Chekhov’s Three Sisters, everything is not quite as it seems. What begins as an innocent name day party for Irina slowly deteriorates as guests begin to disappear and it seems the sisters harbour some dark secret.
						As the layers are peeled away and the action grows more surreal, we realize that the sisters are putting on an elaborate memory play, taking on the lives of their friends and lovers who have long since died leaving them alone in their small Russian town.</p>
